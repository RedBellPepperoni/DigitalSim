# DigitalSim
 Creating a Digital Gate simulator with configurable chips

This is a planned extension to My Final Year Project for BE in Computer Science.
The main Goal was to create a scalable Digital Logic Simulator using Unreal and c++.
The core part of this project was to create an algorithm that can generate custom logic gate macros using previously made logic gates
